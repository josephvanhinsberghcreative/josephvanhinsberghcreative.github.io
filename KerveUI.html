								<h1> KerveBike Concept Gallery </h1>
								<p>Here is some of the concept work I was briefed to provide for a project which I developed as an eco-friendly solution to transporting to work. The kinetic energy recovery flywheel is a marvel which would allow someone to pedal to work in the morning and then (in theory) transport the energy gathered in the braking process into a battery cell and use it on the way home from work. I named it KerveBike and I took inspiration from Formula 1 in order to conceptualise the engeineering for this. Also below, will be the website UI concept design in a higher resolution.</p>
                                <div class="image main"><img src="images/hairy.png"  alt= "width="" height="" /></div>

								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Artboard 3.png"  alt= "width="" height="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Artboard 4.png"  alt= "width="" height="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Artboard 2.png"  alt= "width="" height="" /></div>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/Artboard 5.png"  alt= "width="" height="" /></div>
								<p>The images above are concept images of the website for the brand which would work as a non-traditional, minimalist approach to life for those who followed it, using unconventional yellow lines as a reoccuring theme and hoilding a consistant colour and style guide for the brand would prove itself as a valuable characteristic.</p>
