                                    <p>Joseph Michael Vanhinsbergh is an Photographer and Graphic Designer from Stockport, born in 2003, Joseph found his creative passions in college when faced with descisions to make about his future, at the time he didn't really understand what job he would like but he knew that he enjoyed Art & Design when he attended school. Fast forward a year Joseph left his first course (leaving L2 witha D*) in Creative Media and took it again, this time going into a harder course in Level 3 Creative Media. In 2022, Joseph used a camera on a trip to see friends in Pourtsmouth for the first time as one of his friends owned a camera, after seeing the difference, Joseph gained a love for cameras and the lifestyle of a modern artist. This is where Joseph is as of yet. </p>
