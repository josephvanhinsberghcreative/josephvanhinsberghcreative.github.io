									<h1>KerveBike<br />
									</h1>
									<p>Here is a project which brought me to think a little outside the box<br />
									I wanted to bring a new direction from a pre-existing solution to travel<br />
									I took a method of Kinetic energy recovery used in F1 cars and used it on a bike, and then branded it.</p>

                                <p> Here is a logo concept I made in Adobe Illustrator after sketching up a design inspired from a bicycle chain mechanism
                                The cicular object behind the gear is a K.E.R.S flywheel and this is the whole reasoh the brand exists (in concept of course) 
                                The flywheel is designed to recover kinetic energy from the breaking process and in theory it would then transfer the energy to a battery cell 'for later'.</p>
                                <h1>Colour Guide<br />
                                </h1>
                                <p> Here I have an example of what the colours in this branding would do to a logo (alternate logo design if you will)
                                    These colours were chosen as they inspired themes of, luck, optimism, renewal, freshness, sophistication and peace. Not to mention they suit the branding quite well in my opinion.
                                </p>

                                <h1>WEB UI</h1>
                                <p>Below are the concept images I developed in Adobe Photoshop for the web UI and how several pages would both work and look like. I took great pleasure in designing this as it was the culmination of my efforts whilst participating in my first year of my course.</p>
